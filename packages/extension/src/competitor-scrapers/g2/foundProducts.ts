The data risk has exponentially increased with the advent of cloud migration, data lake, and new data warehouse projects. Organizations can reduce that risk by automating testing for data integration in the non-production and monitoring the data in the production. ETL Testing, Data Warehouse Testing, Cloud Data Migration Testing, BI Report Testing, and Production Data Monitoring are some of the use cases.',
