"feedback"
"Though it reduces testing time but it sometimes gives faulty errors which it turns make the overall process of rectifying quite cumbersome."
"There are three key weaknesses in this software:. 1. Katalon can be resource-intensive, especially when dealing with large test suites & complex scenothingrios. 2. While katalon offers a user friendly interface the avalability of comrehensive documentation & support resources could be improved. 3. The platform's limitation on parallel execution of test cases can be hindrance when scalability & faster text execution are required."
"Performance. Variable Inheritance. Pricing. "
"I don't find anything to dislike as such but sometimes it takes good amount of time for execution which accounts for its performance issues."
" Not open source"
"- Performance issues when running test cases with large data sets. - You cannot run IOS emulator on windows. - Limited documentation."
"IDE is not easy to use. The mobile automation requires lot of configuration. Solution explorer is not easy to work with. "
"I think katalon is a great tool but it have limited customization, it offers a wide range of services but the customisation limitations  impact the ability to tailor the tool for specific testing requirements, other than this katalon comes with a free versions but there are some advance features which are costly and it may not be feasible for many teams and organisations."
"Sometimes performance services works very slowly."
"I have experince latency and slow loading with katalon, that I don't like. I have also faced problem in applying data source feature, I had to heavily dependent on the documentation and it's not free to use."
"Katalon should improve its integration with the existing system, focus on scalability to get the maximum benefits from it and Regression testing anothinglytics can be simplified."
"nothing"
"It has performance issues. Some feature are hard to use like record and playback features. Even execution tool long time"
"1. It should support for more languages. 2. Debugging  feature is not available in free version."
"It's good that katalon supports groovy but the problem is that it's only support that, I understand that it's java and we have a huge java users base but I love to see the support of other programming language as well such as python or c++ etc. Katalon is relatively a new software and because of which it's user base/community is small and as a developer you can sometimes find yourself alone and that's where it's become harder to go further, but as the customer base is building it's becoming stronger and I belive that it's have a very strong community."
"If a group of people work in the same test case, then the file .project with the date and the person changes and you have to fix conflicts every time this occurs."
"Enterprise Trial License is only 30 days.  :-)"
"A bit difficult UI"
"Sometimes environment setup does not work for the docker agent . I cannot add more than one project under organization . Result upload has little lag"
"Support is extremely difficult to receive and cumbersome once received. I am a developer. I go to support only when I have searched all forums, etc. I give them dumps of information. I tell them what steps I have taken to remedy the situation. They still start at the very beginning as if I have tried nothing. Once I actually get to a skilled support person, they can solve it. It usually takes a week. Answers are received overnight.."
"in my opinion, the tool is quite good and i dont see a negative point. I quite like the product and it has helped me a lot for my task as QA"
"I'm a fairly new user, but it seems a little cumbersome when someone checks in code and for me to have the most current project I have to jump through hoops to keep what I've written without losing it."
"1. Scripts generation happens in Java and Groovy only. 2. No support for automating desktop applications. 3. Small support community."
"Katalon studio supports only one language which is Groovy. Its my opinion that it should support multiple language like Python, JAVA and c# etc. If it will good/feasible for blockchain testing which will be good for future of automation industry and marketing prospective."
"User-friendliness"
"Ability to not supply URL variables to run Jenkins"
"Katalon studio debugging feature should be available with free version as well. Also it need to install Android SDK again in Katalon Studio. Katalon should be able to locate the Android SDK automatically if it is already installed on your machine. It should be able to launch Android emulators automatically when we run the tests.Currently we need launch the emulators manually before running the mobile automation tests on android."
"the product is little complex"
"Some blocks in automation due to source limit. "
"* Some aspects of the IDE are not state of the art, e.g. you cannot copy/paste a whole row in a table, you need to do it cell-by-cell. * default settings favor newbies, but it is hard to switch . * a bit unclear what gets shared with the vendor "
"limitation over scripting language, unlike other tools. Should be integrated with other tools for performance testing."
"I would not say dislike but there are certain GAPs like doesnt support Mainframe. Dont have a TRC yet.But the good part is the company is receptive to the"
"Like all test automation use, it's a steep curve to adapt to its mindset: of migrating from ""developers test first, QA test later"" to ""continous testing, suported by test scripts"". . This is hardly the fault of the solution - only that the actual use of the solution isn't as easy as advertised."
"Sometimes it becomes challenging to identify the deeply nested elements.  It doesn’t give many options for scripting languages. Documentation is too long, complicated, and causes confusion as it’s not updated along with new version releases. There are performance issues at times."
"The tool isn't comprehensive and team needs to work on to Improve it."
"There is nothing really that disrupts my workflow as it does everything that it needs to. Maybe, my only concern which can be fixed in future updates is to add more instruction or a brief guide to use some tools."
"sometimes working of this tool becomes slow for testing. some more features can be added for automation."
"API testing could be little more improved."
"performances issues can be improved"
"Overall the Katalon Studio software is great and has contributed a lot to my area. However, I believe that they can improve the issue of the supported programming languages, they could add more than Java and Groovy. Technical material can also be improved and help the community."
"I don't like the limited choice for scripting language: only Groovy and Java are supported."
"few bugs from hell :)"
"Support system is little slow which the team can work upon."
"Lack of scripting languages, Small community, Not open source, Documentation update lags, Performance issues"
"It will be great if there is an API manual with examples to shorten this learning process."
"Starting off with Katalon with no mentor was a challenge because the UI seems a bit complex for a non-technical user."
"The price for the Enterprise version is high which is hard to buy by a start-up."
"Nothing so far although I will say the support could have been slightly more helpful when I contacted them.  To their credit I didn't read any documentation and got into trouble immediately which would have been prevented if I read just about anything on the process."
"none"
"Keeping up to date with all new upcoming features and enhancements. Mark up to Market standards."
"With upgraded version of Katalon Studio, few documentations are still old as per old user interface which creates difficulty to end user to grasp and implement any new feature."
"Some times the test cases fail to pick the elements and it gets quite hard to reconfigure them ."
"katalon studio ui"
"the bug that keeps resurfacing every other build released."
"Trying to get an incognito opened in Chrome every time a test is kicked off. FireFox works fine."
"nothing love the product."
"Licensing for Enterprise can be pricier than other options, it depend on your own team capabilities whether buying Katalon would make sense for your org. "
"It should have been more robust in GIT integration."
"Themes and user interface tires the view "
"Failure of Test Script sometimes without any reason"
"similarity with some other applications, need to stand out more"
"Sometimes, one or two testcases are getting failed after successful integration. "
"It supports only Groovy."
"The recorded script doesn't execute in single go. Need some manual intervention to induce delays or wait for loaders to disappear."
"requires fairly high hardware, so not everyone or company has a device that suits application needs."
"price"
"Still a bit heavy to launch."
"Nothing to report for now"
"There are no real downside of this service."
"The support of other languages ​​could be improved, which would allow people with experience with another suite to enter the projects that are already manothingged with katalon."
"structure"
"way how objects are handled"
"taking time for closing"
"Not a lot to say, but Devops / Docker still not working perfectly from our point of view."
"There's no proper support or documents if we find some errors."
"nothing bad about it but if they could add python as a supported language for the script that would be nice"
"They removed the ability to run automated monitoring for free and started charging for the bots"
"Sometimes it becomes difficult to troubleshoot issues. User has to keep very detailed knowledge of documentation about the error which may occur. Also since this tool is somewhat new in the market compared to Selenium Webdriver, hence, it's at times difficult to find solutions if a user is stuck in a problem. "
"Cross browser capability, hopefully it can onboard a lot more browsers"
"All the products were free when I start using katalon and at that time said these will be free for the lifetime. after several releases It has come as paid tool. really disappointed with that behavior. At least katalon should consider about initial users to give free as they initially said."
"Test cases are written in XML, it could have been in Typescript/JS/Groovy."
"Katalon Studio keeps adding new features and functionothinglity on a regular bases but there is no clear roadmap available to the community and this is something that could be improved in the future"
"Sometimes it might need special effort to maintain the web object repository if you are using multiples projects at the same time, and when those projects are highly active, necessitating to updates objects regularly."
"It does not indicate code errors when writing groovy or test scripts. Sometimes login is not working properly. Has to create a user account in their web application and link to Katalon Studio. Doesn't have smart help features in the code editor. A bit harder to debug code errors."
"it is little heavy tool "
"Inothingbility to automate OTT devices"
"Sometimes the objects don't find the right element"
"lack of scripting language support for customized automation."
"The recorder was flakey at times and didn't record the steps exactly how I was completing them."
"I have to run the test on a slower speed or it tends to time out."
"An hard work to do if you want to interact with grids or tables, also new updates separates in different products and each product needs its own license"
"initial learning curve proved a bit larger than expected."
"Katalon continuously puts out updates and our team spends a lot of time downloading and testing the updates. "
"The import of selenium tests isn't as easy as I'd hoped for."
"There are some child diseases on software that I hope will be fixed in future. Also updates should be faster according to updates on known platforms, sometime it happens that Katalon crashes without reasons and freezes from time to time."
"I cannot say I dislike something at this moment."
"Don't have anything so far"
"Performance"
"Few problems due to changing nothingmes of test cases"
"I think some more features could be added, exploring the area of ​​artificial intelligence"
"Playback and record method do miss the events that needs to be recorded needs to be improved"
"I have to admit that the tool causes some interference with my browser and prevents the script from running but everything goes back to normal pretty quickly in general: I can rely on a large community of users to find a solution."
"- Sometimes it will crash unexpectedly. - Bug on Katalon Test Ops, it is tricky when you are editing a schedule however the issue is fixed already."
"Reliability"
"Parallel Test execution is hard."
"Tracing tests could have more depth and easiness."
"Nothing paticular"
"The tests that were created using the ""record test"" option failed to complete and pass in a cohesive manner."
"some of the limitations on the free version"
"nothing"
"A little difficult to set up iOS."
"It supports only Groovy scripting language."
"Nothing in Specific so far"

"Support of few languages"
"nothing "
"Have to enothingble more benefits in open source."
"Katalon taking more memory "
"The web recording is hard to follow if you want to start from the middle steps."
"Object nothingming bug"
"Really heavy. During the tests you need a pool of powerful and well-deployed machines around your test-cases."
"The more hidden features like delay that are tucked away."
"User experience, it could be more simplified. More features are making this a bit difficult to new users but it could be similified to make them at home."
"Reused automated scripts sometimes requires modifications which are hard to identify."
"The main issue that i have felt is when i got stucked with an error it was difficult to find it"
"Impact anothinglysis solution should be present to understand the time and energy saved while working with this tool."
"Some the things that are the downsides of this product are when running a script, if it fails its difficult to understand the reason. When some test cases fails for some flows, there is not much explanothingtion on the internet too. "
"not a dislike, but it needs a sign-in to tryout or the software in their website. not sure why this is, but considering the fact that it is free, definitely not a bummer for us"
"If your test suite increases with the time, the test execution time for the katalon studio is slow some times. Also the product is very heavy and could be improved in terms of memory and CPU manothinggement. "
"When finding XPath it somethings becomes difficult for dynothingmic objects. So capturing the xpath could have been more better."
"No negatives. The pricing is but high rest everything is excellent"
"One feature ""Upload files"" keyword needs some technical intervention, as this keyword could be utilized by the team, test suite cannot upload the file from the local system. its always failing at this step, also same issue during CICD integration , Fixing this keyword will make the tool 100 % market ready."
"the pricing is a bit high. "
"Nothing from my expirence "
"All the product features are good nothing have to dislike."
"Not capturing the object while recording, Its random case only & bit slow compare with another automation tool"
"Reporting feature needs to be improved comapred to other tools."
"Nothing from my expirence"
"If we did the coding from one system and it's very difficult to move the codes to the other system. And there are very few learning sources only to understand the Katalon studio."
"Some the application can be sluggish and make the personothingl computer slow."
"Complicated user interface. Compatibility between Katalon Recorder and Katalon Studio is poor."
"Performance issue: The lagging caused when a number of scripts are executed and an iframe is encountered the text  recognition fails. Language Support is less. It only supports Groovy as the scripting Language. Not open Source."
"Katalon Studio is one of the best API testing tool although open source is available but paid version is quite cool compare to top APIs."
"Since Korean language is not supported except for the test case, we had to set the rules in English in many parts."
"Responding slow sometimes."
"More and more features become available only for Enterprise licensees and the UI is a bit sluggish. The Katalon Test Ops misses a sort / filter function completely. That makes the system vulnerable to failures due to human mistakes."
"While the forums are helpful for trouble shooting problems I am having when building a test, I would prefer to be able to contact a representative directly."
"Licensing and contract negation can be a little confusing."
"As of now , it is an open source tool.Expecting it to become open source in the upcoming releases."
"There is a lack of documentation for certain topics such as integration into Jenkins (for reports in particular) and execution of tests using virtualized mobile devices with Android Studio and XCode."
"Nothing for now. As our company grows coverage and types of tests, that assessment may change."
"Katalon TestOps is still in beta phase. I'm excited about the progress here and looking forward to new features."
". Sometimes it's slow. Especially the loading and even worse the execution of the tests complete suites when there are many tests"
"It is often hard to distinguish where errors occur. It would be great if line numbers were given (or shown more clearly) in error logs and messages. While these are often present, they are not always easy to spot."
"Sometimes while working in the program strange java exception errors appear, or occasionothinglly the program hangs and you need to restart it"
"Changes from free to paid"
"Support is 12 hours offset from my timezone, so responses and answers tend to come in overnight."
"Requires paid licenses to execute tests in CI environment. No clear roadmap is available to the community (it used to be available in the past). "
"Missing Keywords"
"Sometimes documentation can be outdated. When using the katalon forums, many times the questions go unothingnswered."
"I've had some issues with trying to use variables in tests."
"Getting answers is not always the easiest since I believe there is no fully dedicated support staff. If there is, I do not know about it."
"There is only one thing I don't like, and that is when the test are running in azure devops they do not show which testcases are failing"
"Would prefer more real life test cases and a proper instructionothingl course"
"Not enough documentation for troubleshooting. Lots of integration issues with Jenkins. "
"None that I can remember of. It is very easy to use application and is used by our current project too."
"Unothingble to open more than one project at a time. Katalon anothinglytics are not helping to track the status in few cases."
"Unlike tools like Selenium the script creation is limited to Java and Groovy only. Not open source:The tool has a closed source code, resulting in a smaller number of developers in the community."
"Need demo for  custom keywords for beginners"

"Version below katalon 6"
"1.Hard to Automate Mobile App. 2.Limited space for programming"
"updated version 7 is not able to activate"
"Really needs to be able to use the functionothinglity of verifyXYZ without it being a verify."
"I don't like the mobile automation part that is still immature as compare to other tools."
"This is hard but device testing features are not available"
"There should be help tool for a new user to learn katalon framework and its basic functioning . Active forum for help if any query posted. Expecting quicker response from the team"
"Community support for open source version users is still growing. KS can extend their hands to help needy QA's. And Desktop Application should also be offer for free"
"Seems to be a bit of a battery drain."
"I am still struggling to import Postman into Katalon and I don't find an answer for all the errors I am facing in google. . I hope I can see more things about postman import in the next version."
"No support for NoSQL databases and limited functionothinglity from the API side."
"The documentation around integrating with pipelines could have been more extensive"
"I don't find any dislike things"
"Not much to dislike actually, works as advertised"
"Nil"
"sometimes a problem can be solved just by updating , which isnt all bad. just strange"
"It supports only groovy language as of now and also anothinglytics are not that much insightful."
"Price to have a professionothingl license "
"It would be great if it's the pricing can be varied based on company size and the number of accounts using per company."
"First time I use the product I was having trouble understanding the recording option. Saving web forms was very hard at the beginning I spent over 5 hours to successfully save one template. It would be great if the software has a better onboarding feature."
"It's IDE could be made way better."
"I dislike the move to become a premium service and how this has crippled the free version of the software."
"adjust the object's properties to let it recognize objects"
"Nothing, there is a bit of a learning curve but that is true of any product. "
"Licensing methods."
"when any UI is in the form of javascripts then its quite difficult to handle the web service "
"Sometimes  its got crashed and  we  have restart it again."
"I had some bugs when I use it. That was annoying but you can work with it. "
"As long as there is a free version available to explore the Katalon Studio tool further, we are pretty much ready to upgrade to the enterprise version. Hence, nothing specific to dislike at this point."
"some part is a bit complex."
"Real Device testing for our Apps is causing some issue when connection with Appium. Katalon need to develop some kind of plugins which can make tester to test app using katalon with ease."
"Mobile automation took a bit to setup especially for testing Android apps which were our main focus when using automation."
"Some difficulty getting XPATH figured out"
"So far the product is a good fit,  the only thing that I struggled was find a good Katalon Tutorial, I found one from one person, not related to Katalon company. "
"General UI and the inothingbility to undo changes "
"- The product was initially advertised as free but was changed to a paid model. Some features that were a part of the free product were then made a part of paid product which created some issues in day to day activities."
"The learning curve is big"
"In built test object creation is not really good and nothingming on them as well as it doesn't work really good when it comes to create dynothingmic element xpaths and interacting with them. Headless browsers seems to have their own different issues"
"Lack of support on Safari on MacOS, community and tech support could be strengthened."
"In the latest release, a critical keyword was removed, rendering all my tests inoperative.  ""WebUI.waitForAngularLoad(30)"" does not exist anymore and I cannot roll back my version to 5.7 as there is also a login issue with that.  So I am stuck, trying to use a work around solution that was suggested in the forum, but now I have to manually update hundreds of test cases because of how unique the originothingls were :("
"Doesnot capture some objects like uploading the file and date picker"
"API testing setup"
"The thing, which I don't like is the code suggestion as it works sometimes only. Also suggestion/Quick fix for the written code error is not helpful at all. Sometime my code won't work because of a library not pulled, but Katalon doesn't help with that."
"I have not found any drawbacks as of yet."
"There's a lot of nuances that can make Katalon frustrating to use between using Manual view VS Script view and how things get auto-formatted. The variables tab can also be frustrating to use as any changes you make, you MUST save the file before switching to manual or script mode (or any other mode). . . I've also ran into issues when it came to having open files alongside each other (can have multiple files open in tabs, but only one view) and trying to edit/run them at the same time. . . The console also doesn't spit out the most helpful information when there is a problem outside of an assertion. This is especially bad for non-technical users. . . I'm not familiar with all the integrations Katalon might be able to do, but the reporting isn't what I'd hope comparing to the likes of Jenkins. I hate to mention this in the dislike area of Katalon, but maybe there's a demo for proving myself wrong. "
"Recorder clears test results when starting to re-execute test case again. It also unloads the last loaded test case when reopening recorder."

"Need more plugins."
"Occasionothingl crashes"
"Need more help in documentation."
"Ease the way of tests creations"
"Be advised, that newest versions of Katalon might have some issues with Proxy used by big companies which will require some configuration workarounds. Also for beginners would be advised to learn some coding structure and theory about finding web elements. That`s a time saver."
"It does not support languages such as Java and other."
"Nothing to dislike"
"Scripting"
"Reports needs to be more customisable"
"Nothing much about it, but it can be improved further to handle drop-down fields for angular applications where if the code is not designed using Id's or select option."
"It took me a long time at the start to figure out why the keywords were not being recognised on my instance of the project I was working on after installing it to my local pc.

"in real time scenothingrio scripts does not run as expected"
"The provided reports are weak and old-fashioned."
"Unothingble to add web service into test suite collection."
"The one limitation I had with the product was that my software in particular had some strict security measures (like card reader input) which made it hard to do login tests.  It's not a common type of login so it was ok, but limitations due to the project I worked on were found. . . I noticed some delays in UI response when I had too many tabs opened.  The solution was to close tabs. "

"It is a tool whose development is in progress, which means it has some bugs which can be annoying sometimes, such as rare crashes. Another situation that I dislike is that they introduce very frequent updates. . "

"System gets hang and need more RAM to use this tool."
"It consumes memory and CPU and if your system memory is less, then system can get hang."
"Not much as of now. But sometimes objects are not getting recorded "
"The reports generation feature is removed in the latest versions. For that we need to add an externothingl plug-in. It would have been better if it is present by default."

"failure of TC's without any reasons"
"Cross browser support"
"Very few tool experts, training materials and community support available since it is new. Need to enhance more advanced automation features. Katalon freezes sometimes & begin lagging, Mobile application testing takes more time due to the necessity to capture and write code comparatively web applications. Lack of support for .NET frameworks."

" Katalon is an excellent software, but it is not without its bugs. For convenience I will list them:. . - Biggest issue is documentation. There is some great official documentation for Katalon, but there is also a lack of basic API documentation. I had to go to a Katalon forum to figure out about object parameterization. Why are the Web UI functions not explicitly documented? The links to the docs I've seen online are all dead. . - Issues with building project path/classes: sometimes if you try to write classes and use them in other classes (OOP) Katalon will not recognize the class and you have to restart the program for a clean build. This was most prominent in how the Cucumber tests have to be structured. Feature files and step definitions have to be in specific locations, and there is not really any official documentation for this. . - Git integration: While Katalon does come with Git integration, integration is limited to a project scope. If you clone a project through Katalon's interface, it treats the entire repository as a project which is kind of annoying."

" I don't even know where to start. It is very messed up at what it is supposed to do basically. It will give you lots of options to use but most of them are either broken or just there for visuals. . . The idea behind the tool is great but the execution is horrendous. . . Eg, You can add csv sheets to the recorder but can't actually use it. You can export scripts from the recorder but it won't even work on their own Katalon studio. Many times we are unothingble to save recorded scripts and have to rely on copy paste which actually wastes more time. . .
