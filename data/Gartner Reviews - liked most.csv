I do like how the console would spit out failures for assertions. They make a nice little graphic breaking down the various parts of the assertion statement. Kudos to you there, Katalon team! 

Organization of keywords make it helpful for reusing tests and various test objects (elements in the GUI such as buttons, dropdowns, input fields, etc). It can get messy/unwieldy, but I can see after a time and with proper organization, you can get the tree structure to be helpful. Especially for non-technical people. When it comes to organizing scripts, it's also helpful in that regard. "
