super less coding time spent compared to other software i used.
"Automation! Beats manual testing repetitive items! We can use for API testing too which is a plus for us. We can test faster with Automation with the small Quality Assurance team of three testers/Engineers that we have. We need more QA personnel but Katalon definitely helps our small company with large testing tasks. We have created suites of testing that is shared amongst our team, so helpful.  I also like that you can have an excel sheet of data and program which values to use from the data sheet when running our tests."
it can be used in various ways. including to fill the forms (not what it was ment for but it works.)
"Personally I like that I can use Katalon Studio on my own  on my day to day, yet if any of my projects/teams requires Test Automation  I know that buying a Runtime Engine allows me to integrate into our CI workflow."

"I do like that, once set up, you could have a lot of your team be able to contribute and organize automated tests. It might not matter what their skill level is, as Katalon is more or less able to provide tools for both UI and back end testing. 

I do like how the console would spit out failures for assertions. They make a nice little graphic breaking down the various parts of the assertion statement. Kudos to you there, Katalon team! 

Organization of keywords make it helpful for reusing tests and various test objects (elements in the GUI such as buttons, dropdowns, input fields, etc). It can get messy/unwieldy, but I can see after a time and with proper organization, you can get the tree structure to be helpful. Especially for non-technical people. When it comes to organizing scripts, it's also helpful in that regard. "
