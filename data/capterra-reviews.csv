null,1,"Katalon is an excellent software, but it is not without its bugs. For convenience I will list them:

- Biggest issue is documentation. There is some great official documentation for Katalon, but there is also a lack of basic API documentation. I had to go to a Katalon forum to figure out about object parameterization. Why are the Web UI functions not explicitly documented? The links to the docs I've seen online are all dead. 

- Issues with building project path/classes: sometimes if you try to write classes and use them in other classes (OOP) Katalon will not recognize the class and you have to restart the program for a clean build. This was most prominent in how the Cucumber tests have to be structured. Feature files and step definitions have to be in specific locations, and there is not really any official documentation for this.  

- Git integration: While Katalon does come with Git integration, integration is limited to a project scope. If you clone a project through Katalon's interface, it treats the entire repository as a project which is kind of annoying.

- Reports: It seems strange that Katalon offers so much flexibility but then doesn't allow users to customize their reports and build them as they see fit. 

- Object repository: There should be a way to import test objects/have a shared object repository between projects.  Can you just put all your tests under one project? Yes, but it doesn't always make sense to do so and can lead to a cluttered project.",0.6,0.8,0.8,"We are using Katalon Studio for GUI automation.

Its intuitive interface requires a minimal learning curve and with the official documentation online, someone with zero testing/coding experience can write a comprehensive test. Test suites and collections allow enterprise level testing by allowing users to run numerous tests in series or parallel in different browser configurations.

If you have some experience as a programmer, Katalon's modularity allows it to be extremely flexible. Programmers can write robust keywords (functions) and classes, that can extend testing functionality. The Cucumber integration makes it easy to write BDD tests. Katalon also allows you to import .jar files to extend functionality making the program even more robust.

Manual testing of applications also slows down this rapid process. Considering the different factors such as slowness as well as multi-platform support, cross-browser, responsive design and more, an application's manual test may leave you with unexpected complications and extra efforts.
So what do we do then? Remedy Automation Tests:
Although the automation test may seem to take more time at the beginning, it has proved to be a more effective approach in the long term in terms of both time and resources since the time of the automation solution. In projects that require intensive regression testing, their utility greatly increases. The ability to re-use the established test scenarios by other teammates is also a big plus.
Katalon Studio is a program that you can use to test your Web and Mobile applications. Java-based program can use all the features in a free way. You can start using the program without having any technical knowledge. You can create test cases quickly thanks to the keywords in the program.
One thing I would like to mention is the Cross Platform feature. The script you write is a program that allows you to test Cross Platform (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internel, etc.) without writing additional code. I recommend you to use.The interface is useful, but it has a lot of integration with many systems such as JIRA, GIT, KATALON ANALYSIS BETA. Has a very strong reporting structure.
