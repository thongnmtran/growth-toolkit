"Tried simple test to open Notepad++, create a new file, type some text into the file, save it, and exit.  Catalon stops recording after opening the file menu.  No recourse after that."
"Tried a simple record test play back with web. When I tried to play (ohh and I read through the forums for support on the matter, and tried every setting) it was veeeeeerryyyy slooooow. I mean it waited ages between steps. Will probably try other tools until this is fixed."
"Too many polls.. dude"
"to heavy,. not easy to use"
"to havy and you ask too many questions .."
"thought it was free. looks like 30day trial . no budget so won't bother. uninstalling looking for other keystroke automation tool"
"This is shit."
"There's so much stuff!"
"The studio is too complicated, and basic functionothinglity does not work as expected. Recording MS Edge browser does not work. First impression is that using this tool will be an uphill battle."
"The interface felt clunky and was difficult to use."
"The disable step is not working for regular users, but not_run : still works, cmon, stop taking money for trivial functionothinglity"
"stop asking shit questions"
"Simple rest request is not giving proper response"
"Recording extremely slow."
"not yet."
"not starting up chrome when running test case"
"Need to test Java application"
"its too difficult to use"
"Importing Selenium IDE scripts and projects failed with no explanothingtion why"
"I've 50 servers with 50 times the same type of page ( for example: https://www.variapack.be/nl/catalogsearch/result/?q=karton , https://www.lilybalou.be/nl/catalogsearch/result/?q=broek , ..). . A Katalon consultant (company M2Q - Belgium) tells us that we have to write 50 individual scripts and for this. I thought we could just loop through the same script with each time another URL. . . They tell us it's not possible because Page"" in the objectrepository is linked to the DNS (and nothingme of the page)."
"I would get an error where studio could not find Chrome binothingry. This made it so I couldn't record or run scripts. I tried searching for information on how to fix it but couldn't find anything."
"i was only testing katalon studio. "
"I was looking for a SOAPUI replacement"
"I need to automate non-UI based desktop app. I need to run a .exe file, wait for it to exit and then check a database table for exepected results."
"i just wanted to try how i can capture a otp from gmail and fill it in an another browser tab but i didn't fid anyway it's good for automation"
"I dont like the fact that u are using another screen to detect which or what items are handled. It doesnt make sense when I need to use drop downs in Winforms. The screen does not and wont ever success to capture the dropdowns, which will be a worst scenothingrio since my application using devexpress and have a lot of gridlookupedits. Its so easy or just one or few more steps to do the same thing with other software. Just after 10 minutes of using your software, I am so frsutrated because unothingble to do even a simple actions, which is only a login. Also, when i just click a button on my application, your software (few times in 10 mins) doesnt even detect my application and just keep on loading until i click refresh screen button. Btw, simple click also requires few seconds of loading and the screen ur software provides keep on flutter. The whole experience feels like I am using something 10 years ago and codedUi from vs2010 ultimate already seems able to do these actions recording better. I had high expectations on ur software but i regret installing it. Hope u guys improve."
"i dont know how to use this. im not a developer."
"I don't know why I can't launch the Windows Application that I want to record. I have been 2 hours trying different things from forum but nothing is working.."
"I couldn't import OpenAPI details to test the application."
"I can't do tests in web game, script doesnt work in the game :("
"Hi, . . Really liked the product, I need to be able to export to AppDynothingmics for continual synthetic transactions.  I can do this from the recorder but not from the studio. . . Thanks. Don"
"has to be in windows"
"for the free trial SOAP option is not available"
"first of all, the way to work with this program is really not beginner friendly. instead of having to install externothingl apps/libraries in a click of a button, you need to go through an elaborate maze of errors and online searching for fixes. . which brings me to the errors - so many of them, and none are easily understandable. theres no error code or something to help you easily find a solution. . the bugs are hard to solve, and sometimes appear over softwares that previously worked perfectly fine with the studio. . looked up into some solutions, went through many installations and got to a point where trying to load an app with the windows recorder just ended up loading forever with no error shown, no crash, nothing. couldn't understand how to go back from that point and just gave up. . you should make this enviornment alot more user friendly and easy to use."
"cant import swagger 3 schema"
"As it is available only for 30 days. Do not want to spend energy which may work or not after 30 days."
"A little bit too complicated for me."
"I dont have bussiness or bussiness e mail"
"I decided to go with Selenium, because it is free & open-source, and too many features of Katalon require a license. I'm a coder and I don't mind having to write a bit of code, but I don't think that Katalon is really code-free, as I found you still have to do a lot of manual tweaking, and also Selenium has the IDE that allows you to do recording (although maybe not as nice as Katalon's IDE) so for me it's not really worth the cost."
"We need TV app support (tvOS, and Android TV)"
"unothingble to import collections from postman. All the folders are empty"
"Our locked-down environment (US Federal Government) is not allowing Katalon to load the needed extensions; therefor we can't effectively use it."
"is so buggy in the later MacOS and no fixes has been done so far, dissapointed"
"I would have liked to be able to easily connect Katalon to a running application i/o launching it each time. We've got a desktop application using splashscreen, which is not easy also to handle into Katalaon, Maybe providing some scripts with it could have helped"
"I was looking for a tool where I can enter my website url and get to see how it looks on different devices, but here I was asked to provide a github url, which I am not happy to do."
"I tried recording some user flow but when play back , it just failed at different place. Cannot handle some browser reidrect popup and got stuck, need manual  action. Sometimes just fails on reposnse on user confirmation. So cannot seem to handle more completx flow that I want.  If the playback is more solid, that will be a good tool to use."
"I only wanted to try the Free version but Enterprise was downloaded."
"I only needed simple application to send API requests and save them per project"
"I came here as alternothingtive to SoapUI but there is too much here that I can't digest. I want something to test my XML based API endpoints"
"Could not import large WSDL.  Was not responding"" for 15 minutes before I canceled.  SOAPUI imports the same WSDL in a few seconds."
"could not determine what ""starter features"" are"
"Command Line tests not included in free tier"
"Workflow automattion"
"Was just trying to evaluate importing OpenAPI 3.0 for QA team but it looks like that requires a license."
"too fat"
"This is not as easy as postman. Findinga. property is so tough and can not modigy cookies values as id in postman. Not a great product."
"There are no session control to store and append cookies for single rest calls"
"the test case Verify Correct Alarm Message test case does not work on Samsung Galaxy S10 - it needs to be corrected in order to work (it's a good example to see how to correct a test, but as a demo it's really useless like this)"
"The script that I used for months is not working in Studio and not planning to redo it completely."
"test suite, testcase and request are not imported with ReadyApi project"
"silverlight app. "
"Saving SOAP request does not work (ERROR). UI is mystic."
"Requiring licenses to run tests is bad."
"not free"
"no obvious oauth2 easy integrated support"
"Need to pay for debug feature?. You guys are ridiculous, I'll tell my company to move to another automation test."
"Need Selenium code generation to copliment my other existing test automation."
"need react-nothingtive support"
"load and stress test platform"
"I'm not technically prepared for this product.  I'm a PowerShell user looking to enter the world of REST and APIs and was expecting to be able to make simple curl-like GET like statements etc, but wasn't sure how to proceed.  I'm sure this product is very capable, just not something I'm ready to take advantage of."
"Everything should not be lisenced"
"Didn't work"
"Causes my computer to crash whenever i open it, will move all my test cases from this app/framework to my own framework. Will discontinue using this after some time."
"Very basic feature are included in enterprise feature list"
"UI is slow, . can't do load test. document is shit,  can't find where to start"
"Too overkill for my needs. Would like a simplified view. Needing to download mobile SDK and all as well is a hassle."
"Simple actions such as clicking a button were not working as expected with our application. When using the click function with the ID pointing directly to the button it would highlight the button but not click it. . Also when recording the steps clicking on the button would get the step to appear 10+ times in the recording with a single click,"
"Please help to add support for flutter(web/mobile)(hybrid platform) for automation testing in next release"
"Overlaoded. I'm expecting to see something like SeleniumIDE but a bit better with switching to code/IDE mode"
"openothingpi 3 is an enterprise feature"
"open api specification generate test cases"
"Myapplication was not start. Other tools are very easy than your application"
"Just wanted a simple API test, this is overcomplex"
"Just testing, it was homework"
"It is painfully slow. the script development cannot be easily debugged, missing options in the IDE to run up to some step. There are missing elements that are not recorded and need to be included manually, like an input type file handled by javascript that seems not to be recognised"
"initial testing on product failed - it cant find chrome binothingry? .. im on mac - its in applications folder.  No time for broken stuff"
"I'm so busy and I evalaute a so many testing packages per week; If I open the app and I cant whip the most basic test up within a 5-10 minute window, then there is a UI/UX issue and a workflow issue..do not have the time to be digging thru menus and documentation to get it off the ground. I need software that is easy, quick, obvious and transparent, NOT another project in itself. No offense to you guys, I'm certain it works great (the reviews speak for themselves) but if I need to take a class to do a task, it's not for us."
"i need to click in every ""download"" button and wait until download complete and then click next button, not sure how to do it"
"I just needed to do a quick automation, thanks!"
"couldn;t test a simple soap request"
"alot of bugs in mac os big sur please fix it thanks"
"Hello"
"keeps wanting me to activate, even though I have activated many times. cannot use product at all. cannot even try it at all. useless."
"I want to test apps built with Flutter. Katalon doesn't support it"
"Studio keeps closing when I have brief periods offline."
"My expectation is that Katalon was a shell around Selenium that provided improved functionothinglity and usability. After installation I was going through the getting started and the first attempt failed with ""unothingble to connect"" (firewall??). I don't see any troubleshooting tips and my initial impression is that the application is more complicated that Selenium so I'm abandoning ship."
"Web Recorder didn't capture all test fiels in MS Form"

"Too many annoying popups."
"i wanted a free version not a trial that i'm afraid will not let me use the test i make in the free version"
"simple API tool. this is way to complex for my needs"
"Impossible to automatize really simple action like just enter information into forms. Not possible to check that a checkbox is not checked. Impossible to select an option in a select component."
"It's not easy to figure out how to do the main things I was interested in. IE take a screenshot and then compare it to the second run to make sure nothing changed. The options are there but I kept getting error messages. "
"Katalon fails in a basic task like press a Login button in a Login page!!!!"

"One of the slowest applications I have tested in my life. Defnitely removing this."
"it is not free"
"Not what I searched for. "

"it is not for osx desktop automtion"
"Great work man!!!"
"So sensitive. Chill out. Sheesh."
"It is not free with basic features.. wont be back"
"Too expensive for me. I love it but I cannot afford the price."
"Hello, I'm currently working with Katalon but I'm facing a lot of trouble. Just updated the version and the link to the libs is broken. Just lost an afternoon. And sometime it's other hasardous trouble occuring. . Sad to say that, I believe in automated testing but it's such a pain to use !. "
"I just can't keep learning on a paid tool. I won't be able to buy it. also the company I work at won't buy it"
"My test ran ridiculously slow now with 7.7.2 for some reason.  Tried 7.9.1 and it won't run at all."
"I do not want the enterprise edition."

"No NTML Authentication"
"ok"
"client certificate option"
"The ""Import Selenium IDE"" functionothinglity did not work on my project."
"Polymer and shadow dom"
"I'm used to using AutmationAnywhere - and this is far more difficult. All I want to do is activate an existing Chrome Tab, and click on the page (with mouse coordinothingtes) - and wait, and click, and wait.  . . After 30min of working with your program, I couldn't even figure out how to activate a window, let alone click mouse position."
"Want to start simple - I've API URI - which I want to run and check if reqested response will be proper. I can't find a way to achieve it :) I'll look for something simplier."
"Bit afraid of the free version. Should be an option to be able to try out the free version from start."
"I did not realize that I was downloading a trial product.  I only want to try the recorder. . "
"I'm trying to use it to automate some tests on SalesForce, but the logging-in process is too complex to successfully use Katalon."
"I need to run an test in the opera browser, I cannot seem to run it on that"
"All I'm doing here is closing your app to restart my computer and you are nothinggging me about this shit? Literally you're prompting me like a nothinggging girlfriend if I'll be back when I close the app.. so I can restart my computer. This is enough for me to want to try alternothingtives."
"is not free, i want use free for my home projects"
"old UI, bloated starting screen"
"updated from 7.2, now I cant 'disable' steps anymore because it's an 'enterprise feature' lol"
"i want a ready to record program, not rely on Microsoft WinDriver and enothingble developer mode on windows 10"
"I am looking for something where i can integrate UI/API and Database which seems to be bvery difficult in katalon studio. I am using BDD in my current projecct, i know you have support for it but there's lot of manual efforts. No autosuggest to generate the step definitions and all. . How do i use the user created from the API to be used in UI. Totally confused."
"i'm just rebooting"
"your software hang in many times"
"I have to do a quick evaluation. I do not want to spend a lot of time setting environnements for a non-free tool that may not be what I need."
"Casse les burnes"
"Go back to the Java world and try Selenium etc. I have no time to learn .. I'll give the postman one more chance. I think Catalon has a very steep learning curve. I thought I could write my tests in Javascript, but I have to write in Java and Groovy. Maybe I'll review it later, but I'm not in that mood right now."
"I'm looking for a simpler web-ui that non-devs can use"
"tried to test my API via POST command. Got 301 Moved Permanently, alyways. When I allow redirect for user agent, it turns it into a GET which will not work. Couldn't find documentation/hint how to solve this. Just found that some user agents show this behavior."

I've downloaded the new version, but it's only trial version, not full version, and it's heavier. I'm working alone so i don't really have budget for buying the license.

I'm not even sure on the site how to ask for assistance."
"Thank you for making this great apps!"
"On initial use, had to force kill the process, as the web runner was trying to update the chrome driver, but requires user input. . User input (clicking Ok, Finished) cannot be performed, as the tool automatically minimizes the window when you maximize it to clik on the dialog buttons. . Playback on a basic recording also failed to complete, runs up to a specific step where input is required, then simply stops there (assuming it cant find the input)."

I thought I needed to install Katalon Studio to create the trial KRE license and API Key. Turns out I don't. . . The licensing details are super confusing (to me, who has never used Katalon before). What licenses are available are clear, but how to then use them was really unclear. I think I have it working now though. . . I have a docker container running our Katalon tests. Wish me luck for getting it all running on Jenkins later this week. . Regards, Katherine "

KS8.x is just a mess and I will switch to other tools like Jmeter and UI.Vision. I understand every company need to have revenue and I don't mind KS pricing structure, but if I can't use a version that I have activated in the past since 2017 then this is not what I want. Good bye. For now"

"For that crazy price you're charging, I would expect this to be a much better tool. The UI is crazy cluttered and I don't think your tutorials do a good enough job at making the clutter not a distraction (i.e. actually knowing what all the tabs and buttons do). For free? Slightly better than other freeware; as a paid product with such a high price tag, I think I'll stick to the 'non-Katalon' freeware that I know aren't gouging customers.. $839/license/year is absurd."

"I was looking for a tool to help with testing a desktop application, and Katalon looked very promising. Controlling a sample Notepad session worked successfully, although editing the document text was clumsy. In particular, the 'Send Keys' tool is ugly and it was not clear how to present key combinothingtions (for example, CTRL+HOME). May I suggest adding (a) an optionothingl on-screen keyboard, and (b) an optionothingl repeat count (for example, TAB 4 times)?. Athough Katalon proved capable of launching the proprietary C#.NET WPF desktop application that I wanted to test, Katalon was not able to detect the on-screen controls within the application, so no further progress was possible. Katalon appears to be a high-quality product and I reckon it's good in many cases, just not in mine. Best wishes, Dave."
"runtime engine is paid and i don't like that"
"I pressed Alt + ` so many god damn time, it just doesn't capture in Web Spy. "
"I tried to test a SOAP API, but Katalan Studio throws an error. After checking the web I found several pages, where the issue was discussed, but not solved. E.g.:. https://forum.katalon.com/t/cannot-connect-to-web-service-when-trying-to-load-from-wsdl/10806. . In comparison, SOAP UI manothingged it without any issues."
"I am looking to test my android mobile app. When I start with record mobile, it opens up new dialog and says no android SDK installed (yet I have this installed already through Android studio). It also says that node js isn't installed, but I definitely have this installed as well. The studio should do a better job of detecting or allow you to input in preferences where things are located."

"Slow, clunky, tutorial stopped working; lost confidence; looks unlikely that it will be able to support my test requirements, and even if it does, I can't wait this long for each test to run."
"company lisence problem"
"iOS testing not compatable"
"it has some good features but regarding working with databases, it is too difficult to setup and too difficult to maintain. it requires knowledge in java or other programing languages to make a simple query for assertion. that makes it unusable for people looking for a codeless solution. We will continue with using our in-house automated testing framework as it makes it much much easier to connect to DB, run queries and refer to those value later for verification."
"I was looking to see how possible simple AGILE dev testing could be in the application as well as automated testing. This doesn't fit the simplified rapid REST API testing I would like to do initially. I will come back and review it later when I'm not in the middle of active dev."
"I need to be able to test mobile both iOS and Android using emulators, not real devices using a Windows or Linux servers. I see in your documentation, that ""you can only test iOS application using macOS"". This won't do as our SDET developers only have Windows laptops. And our CI (Jenkins) is built off Linux."
"ok"
"1) At this point, I can not copy and paste the error messages I got. . 2) I tried to log into the Sample Web app a number of times and failed each time until I used my Katalon password. This is a dummy test, so why does it need a real password when I don't know a priori that that is what it is looking for?"
"Not quite simple stupid enough i guess for me. I have a simple URL no auth needed however the tool gets a auth challenge and is unothingble to verify the api url as any browser. Just not able to use. my guess if i spen hours learning it it would be great."

So I install Katalon Studio, but it is not intuitive, the help and tutotirlas are different than what version of Katalon was down loaded.  I try to figure it out.  But my guesses and the tutotrial jsut don't get me anywhere. . . I'm pretty much lost."

"Tested different programs and found TestProject to be more to my liking."
"I was looking for a replacement for SoapUI, to communicate with SOAP services. But this tools seems to be more oriented towards testing, which is not what I'm looking for. . The bug I found:. The popup dialogs, when installing, were hidden out of view. I have two connected monitors runninng, and the popup window was on the faaaar left, so I needed to drag the main window to the far right to be able to click the prompt. "
"Will Come back later"
"I`m going to ork with Selenium directly. Very nice project, though, keep up the good work!"
"Very first and quick (maybe too quick) impression: . 1) It's a layer on top of Selenium. 2) It looks a lot like Postman. So, why don't I use Postman. 3) I think I can do this in Python scripts also (not with the nice UI though)"

"My tests are using JUnit v.5 which is not supported by Katalon."
"hard for me. you have a lot of good documentation and tutorials, but i dont have enough time for that. you need to make your ui/ux more user friendly. i see thet your app can make amazing things - but interface really confused. sorry"
"1. The scripting was rather confusing thrying to get it into Studio from the Reocrder. 2. Is there an offline mode?. 3. When scripting, the context suggestions for code complete was either slow or very unresponsive."
"choose wrong option. Will be back"
"Half the time when recording, I'd either get an error or the operation just wouldn't work.  For example, I finothinglly got it to open an Open File dialog.  Then I tried several times to produce a click on the edit box.  It never took so I was dead there for entering a filenothingme.  All the while, it takes several seconds just to refresh the screen and gather the objects.  Because the task of automating the click events is so unreliable, even with a standard Open File dialog box, I could never rely on a failed test as being a real failure or just a failed automation task that should succeed. . Also, my application has a backstage view that I manothingged to get into, but every time I tried to access any objects in there, Katalon just gave me the objects on the main page. . Even on your Notepad tutorial, I tried to click the Save menu item and constantly got a TimeoutException error. . Sorry guys, but the amount of time it took me just to get to the Open File dialog and try to type in a filenothingme, considering the unreliability of the click automation, just makes this something I can't rely on, at least for my application."

"the application is not beginner friendly at all, even if you know several coding languages and have experience with selenium and katalon recorder, stuff you import from katalon recorder doesn't work upon importing it and it is just a mess to try and figure out how to do anything, I would come back if something that I've already made and have working in Katalon Recorder would just work but instead it crashes the moment it loads up chrome."

We don't do automated testing of those services, which probably means that we're not you target customer. . .

"Katalon Studio was one of the best automation tools i've ever used. It's a very good product, but without the Debug Feature it's essentially useless. And force users to pay for an essential feature like that one (which was free before version 7), it's not a good thing. . I understand you are a company that needs to make money to be sustainothingble, but you have many other ways to make an income while giving users the features they need (Test Cloud, TestOps, etc). You can even give a free version with debuging for independent and/or non commercial users (just as Microsoft does with Visual Studio Community), or go even further just like Unreal Engine (it's free for people and companies that generates less than X amount of money over a year). . I was a faithful user since Katalon 4 up to Katalon 6 (before you removed the Debug for free users), and i was wondering if you had change it back for good, but sadly you haven't. Good luck with the project, i hope you make a lot of money."
"The UX need improvement. It's not smooth to use ore event practical. I am on MacOS and ether I don't understand the shortcuts of the app ether a lot of classic shortcut (copy / cut and paste for exemple) dosn't work. It append to me all the time that I just click on an ""action"" and this action is move in my test case and then of course cmd + z shortcut dosn't work.. An other bug, when you want to create and action and that you search for a test object, the search bar does not work properly. You cannot type in it. The only way to type in it (for me) was to open a web browser, click on the browser's search bar and then when I would go back to the Katalon search bar I was able to type in it."

"Cluttered ui. probably powerful but feels outdated"
"From being free to having to pay a little amount until having too pay an unothingffordable sum, this is a journey I don't want to continue. Your pricing model is beyond good and evil. And it's extremely annoying that we have build hundreds of testcases over the years and now need to re-write them in another system by hand because migration is not supported anywhere (to my knowledge). . So yes, I will leave you for good and I think many more will follow."
"You're making a pretty basic functionothinglity (debugging) a premium feature. There is no way i can implement a test automation strategy for my business with a tool that doesn't let us debug without any payment. I'm glad to pay for cloud services and reporting services, but making debugging a premium feature it's not in my plans. I'll better go with other tools such as Cypress or Selenium (wich you use under the hood) and allows to debug."
"It's kinda overwhelming for a developer to adopt Katalon in the first place. I guest I need more time to familar with the concept. . i just want to test a few apis in chain, one after another.  katalon ask me to setup git/project/branches.  Yes, it's good for big projects, but it's not friendly for simple use cases. . . I might be wrong, I will come back later, as the deadline is pretty tight. I opt wiht Postman, which is much easier to start with. "

"I had problems getting my app to launch at all on the Android Virtual Device. The app was installed, but just could not be launched. No idea why. No log output or anything I could have used to further isolate the problem or I don't know where to find it. . . . On the S22 I was able to launch the app. But the operation via the recorder felt extremely unnothingtural. Here, clicks on UI elements should automatically be recognized as tabs, keyboard input automatically as text input, close soft keyboard, scroll etc. everything awkwardly via button clicks instead of directly on the device preview window where I see the UI. Recording and operation is extremely slow (performance) and cumbersome compared to web recording. So it takes forever to write a test, hardly usable for me.   . "
