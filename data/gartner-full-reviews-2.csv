"Katalon made my life really easy, it is very handy. I am absolutely in love with Katalon.","Katalon Studio is very robust, feature rich and yet easy to use. I was struggling with Selenium before Katalon studio. The most cumbersome part was to downloading the Jar files and add them to the path, add path to environment variables etc. But Katalon made everything easy, it is one stop platform for almost all kind of essential testing and for both kind of testers- Beginners and advanced.
I have tried many other tools which came recently like TestProject, cypress, TestCraft etc. but still Katalon studio is my first choice. 
The reporting tool is very good, it is easy to debug the code with reporting logs. Which otherwise is a tedious task in  Selenium to get the logs, which is only possible with log4j plugin and still a nightmare to use log4j commands after every step.
The integration of API testing again made it handier. So one-stop platform for all kind of testing- Web, Mobile, API etc.
Katalon is releasing new features very quickly, every day when I come to the office, my first task is to go to Katalon website to look for any new feature.

"We Broke It but Love It","The overall experience is a mixed bag which was a given. To elaborate, we implemented an automated API testing suite with chaining of APIs so as to automate workflows rather than individual APIs since the number was really high. The good stuff is the feature set and reporting. With the ability to write in groovy, you can really extend the software to your liking. And there are a lot of useful ways to extend your existing testing suite whenever you like. For example, if you want to add a Data Source to run the same test with different sets of Data, you can do that for existing test cases. No need to start from scratch. The bad part, from the point of view of a developer, is that a lot of functionality is locked. A, there is only SQL support. For anyone automating workflows with APIs, it is better to use a JSON-based document DB like MongoDB. We used it by literally writing the code for it. B, there is no way to publish reports when you are going as rogue as we went. We had to maintain our own pointers and basically rewrite the reporting backend so as to produce the same report as Katalon Studio. This could have been easier if we could increment total number of cases, etc from the code directly. C, Response persistence. Since each test case is a single API and, REST APIs are stateless you need to be able to transfer response of one API to one or more other APIs, resulting in a workflow that imitates the real world. 
The biggest flaw of Katalon is the mess it creates when on any Version Control software. Our systems crashed because of conflicting classpath files. Just add a gitignore. It would not trouble you.
If you are thinking about Katalon, you can definitely go for it.

It is the best option for Web today with its keyword oriented framework, got many integrations with platforms such as TestRail and Jira and now also automates Windows Applications, beside mobile ones with Appium.

One aspect that could receive more attention is the IDE.

I do wish the error messaging was a bit more intuitive. Its difficult to understand what it does not like/find the source to fix. The general UI can be finicky as well.

By non-technical users, I mean those who don't program or code often enough and may resort to manual testing. This tool can certainly help with the process.

When it comes to those who are more technically saavy, there is a script mode where you can edit recordings and write in your own methods utilizing the Groovy language, an OOP language that's Java-syntax-compatible.

It might not matter what their skill level is, as Katalon is more or less able to provide tools for both UI and back end testing. 

I do like how the console would spit out failures for assertions. They make a nice little graphic breaking down the various parts of the assertion statement. Kudos to you there, Katalon team! 

Organization of keywords make it helpful for reusing tests and various test objects (elements in the GUI such as buttons, dropdowns, input fields, etc). It can get messy/unwieldy, but I can see after a time and with proper organization, you can get the tree structure to be helpful. Especially for non-technical people. When it comes to organizing scripts, it's also helpful in that regard. ","There's a lot of nuances that can make Katalon frustrating to use between using Manual view VS Script view and how things get auto-formatted. The variables tab can also be frustrating to use as any changes you make, you MUST save the file before switching to manual or script mode (or any other mode). 

I've also ran into issues when it came to having open files alongside each other (can have multiple files open in tabs, but only one view) and trying to edit/run them at the same time. 

The console also doesn't spit out the most helpful information when there is a problem outside of an assertion. This is especially bad for non-technical users. 

I'm not familiar with all the integrations Katalon might be able to do, but the reporting isn't what I'd hope comparing to the likes of Jenkins.

"Very good, but not ideal","Katalon Studio and Katalon Runtime Engine are very flexible and usefull tools for test automation. It is have many pros: this tool gives a lot of possibilities for various tests, such as web, mobile, and api tests. You can write test scripts yourself in the form of code, as well as using the GUI, which is quite convenient. The most I use Katalon for testing web applications, Katalon allows you to download controls and save in the project for reuse. There are also cons, such as high RAM consumption (but it is becoming less and less important these days), sometimes with large projects, when there are a lot of object repository controls (> 10,000), the project starts to hang, and gui usage can give unpredictable results but this is not critical.","2020/2/12","4","Invited by Vendor (direct, user community)","0","0","Hybrid Cloud and On-premises","FALSE",1581440400000,"118934090","Junior Software Automation Tester & Oper","Banking","<50M USD","IT","Katalon Studio allows me to download controls and save in the project during WEB aplication tests, so i can reuse, as well as modyfy locators of controll elements when it is necessary.","Sometimes the program lags during work on big projects.","NaN","","","","5","NaN","4","Hybrid Cloud and On-premises","Poland",1279762

It has inbuilt keywords and also we can create custom keywords as per our requirements. It supports all popular browsers. It generates a report in all popular formats like CSV, HTML, pdf. You can also analyze tests using katalon analytics. Overall it's good. There are some limitations such as it only supports groovy/java as a scripting language. They should provide support for other languages. It doesn't support canvas-based web app testing.  Sometimes tool freezes. But you can always restart it.

For convenience I will list them:

- Biggest issue is documentation. There is some great official documentation for Katalon, but there is also a lack of basic API documentation. I had to go to a Katalon forum to figure out about object parameterization. Why are the Web UI functions not explicitly documented? The links to the docs I've seen online are all dead.

- Issues with building project path/classes: sometimes if you try to write classes and use them in other classes (OOP) Katalon will not recognize the class and you have to restart the program for a clean build. This was most prominent in how the Cucumber tests have to be structured. Feature files and step definitions have to be in specific locations, and there is not really any official documentation for this.

- Git integration: While Katalon does come with Git integration, integration is limited to a project scope. If you clone a project through Katalon's interface, it treats the entire repository as a project which is kind of annoying.","5","Improve customer relations/service","Overall cost","","5","5","5","Hybrid Cloud and On-premises","India",910764

"Useful, Time Saver, Easy to Use, Good UI and the BEST In the Industry of Automation","Pros: Katalon is easily one of the best open source software tools for GUI automation testing. Its intuitive interface requires a minimal learning curve and with the official documentation online, someone with zero testing/coding experience can write a comprehensive test. Test suites and collections allow enterprise level testing by allowing users to run numerous tests in series or parallel in different browser configurations.

If you have some experience as a programmer, Katalon's modularity allows it to be extremely flexible. Programmers can write robust keywords (functions) and classes, that can extend testing functionality. The Cucumber integration makes it easy to write BDD tests. Katalon also allows you to import .jar files to extend functionality making the program even more robust.

Cons: Katalon is an excellent software, but it is not without its bugs. For convenience I will list them:

- Biggest issue is documentation. There is some great official documentation for Katalon, but there is also a lack of basic API documentation. I had to go to a Katalon forum to figure out about object parameterization. Why are the Web UI functions not explicitly documented? The links to the docs I've seen online are all dead.

- Issues with building project path/classes: sometimes if you try to write classes and use them in other classes (OOP) Katalon will not recognize the class and you have to restart the program for a clean build. This was most prominent in how the Cucumber tests have to be structured. Feature files and step definitions have to be in specific locations, and there is not really any official documentation for this.","2019/5/7","5","Referred (colleague, friend, peer)","0","0","Cloud (SaaS or PaaS or IaaS)","FALSE",1557162000000,"112382120","Developer","Services (non-Government)","<50M USD","Other","With advanced technology, high-quality applications are now inevitable.

"Good tool for automation, amazing features but sometimes displays unstable behavior","I have used katalon studio as a part of my project for web application testing. Initially I found katalon studio very helpful, especially because it is a keyword driven tool(it has some inbuilt keywords and it also allows us to create our own custom keywords), it has advanced features like web recorder, Spy web, which are found in expensive commercial automation testing tools. Being an open source tool, it provided a lot of features which we could use for automating, generating test reports among many more features like integrating with jenkins, github, qTest, jira.
It also has a recent enhancement i.e., a plugin store, which allows us to also create our own plugins.
However, a drawback was that even though it reduced efforts because of a variety of features, efforts were increased when it came to debugging. The tool works so fast during recording that sometimes it misses some objects that need to be captured. So, we have to be extra careful while recording. Same thing happened while running the test script. The script needs time to debug. Sometimes the recorder does not work. Some features like mailing feature, and uploading reports to a cloud based portal 'Katalon Analytics' did not work when I tried to implement them.
The tool has sometimes shown unstable behavior.

" An innovative, ambitious and comprehensive solution.","Katalon Studio is a solution I discovered in November 2017. 

I was doing a POC to implement test automation within my entity. 

I really liked the solution, I was able to present it and it was deployed in more than 16 projects. We run our automated tests locally and in the cloud with CircleCi. We have connected our mobile tests with BrowserStack. The execution results are reported in qTest. 

We now have a real continious testing. 

My ambition is to deploy our solution in other entities of the BNP PARIBAS group.

Thank you for your efforts, your reactivated, your productivity.

Katalon studio is an excellent tool to check out particularly for people who have minimal programming or coding background.

You can also make different test suits run on different browsers in parallel.

The idea behind the tool is great but the execution is horrendous. 

Eg, You can add csv sheets to the recorder but can't actually use it. You can export scripts from the recorder but it won't even work on their own Katalon studio. Many times we are unable to save recorded scripts and have to rely on copy paste which actually wastes more time.

"Good testing tool, but need time to mature before Enterprise ready","I lead a full stack application project and choose Katalon for Web UI and API testing tool as I found it is easy to start and short learning curve.

In begining, the Katalon is quite easy to work with in term of writing test case, capturing test objects. Our QA staff can quickly adapt with the tool without much problem.

The first problem I have encounter is regarding application resource, it could not fit with non-technical  grade laptop QA staff used. Katalon becoming slow and resource consuming and I have to find out for alternative, I then quickly provision an Linux server with Gnome for them to use but Katalon GUI under Linux is just not yet ready for real use case. It is even slower and resource hungrier than Windows' version, increasing CPU and Memory won't help on Linux. I then have to find Windows server as alternative.

After solving the first one, we dive into more complex test case, like parameterize test object so that we don't have to capture every single web UI for testing and embrace reusability, this is where I found Katalon's lack of simplification, our QA staff cannot easily figure it out to do by them self, it is just too complex to enable parameterize test object, first the UI is confusing, we take sometime to make one test object able to support parameterize feature. One reason of confusion is how Katalon use a lot of detection methods e.g. x-path, attributes mixed together, when we try to convert that captured object we have to carefully delete some detection methods otherwise they will messed up.

Another weak point is that, I found Katalon lack to support Linux platform, it seems like Linux is a third citizen, I encounter many problem to integrate Katalon in Jenkins in Linux platform. It is just cannot run under jenkins user.

"Great product - would definately recommend ","I have only been using Katalon Studio for the past 2-3 weeks but i have to say that im extremely impressed so far. I have used other automation tools in the best, but for free, Katalon is an incredible tool. The community aspect to the product is so helpful, within a few hours any issue that i come across will be resolved by one of the developers at Katalon or another avid user of katalon. Im excited for the new store to be realeased as im looking forward to a Bamboo plugin so we can have continous intergration. The set up was pretty straighforward and the web recorder is easy to use. Overall, nothing bad to say from my experience so far. There are a few little bugs but there are plenty of workarounds that ive read about on the community site while waiting for them to be fixed.

"Free tool, serves the automation needs for the applications used to my workplace","I started using Katalon Studio a year ago and it serves the automation needs for the applications I use at my workplace. It’s free of cost which is a huge bonus, easy to automate and user friendly.
To start with it’s very simple to create a record and playback script which can be edited using a manual and script mode with lots of inbuilt keywords to perform validations. My basic knowledge on Java enabled me to create new custom keywords and methods in Katalon library. I could efficiently use the Built in reports to consolidate the test results. Data driven testing support helped to cover all possible test scenarios. 
I managed to use the Integrations with JIRA which worked perfectly fine and saved a lot of time for documenting test evidences and integration with GIT served the script version control.
Joining the Katalon Community was very helpful to get online support and obtain solutions to my queries using this forum. The community is open to suggestions and they do consider the required improvements to incorporate in the future versions they release.  
I would suggest every user with minimum coding experience give it a try as you do not have to pay any cost and no limited using time.

We first created some simple tests.
Just recording and replaying some scenario's.
This worked quit good, but we needed to finetune the test by putting in some delays.
After recording we started with datadriven tests.
We used an excel file which passes variables to our test.
Depending on the value of the variable, our test behaves different.
By  making our test dynamic, we can almost test every flow of our booking process just by changing the data in the excel file.
This makes is very handy to create a lot of tests in no time.
We use the profiles to make our test run in multiple languages and on multiple environments
I think the interface of the Katalon studio is very straight forward.
But sometimes the studio becomes a bit slow.
We use git to push our tests to, so we can work with multiple persons in the same project.
Sometimes we had the problem that there were some testcases , profiles that disappeared.
We fixed this by opening their corresponding xml files. In most cases these files just where corrupted by merge issues.

"Katalon Studio is the best free automation tool but needs community support.","Katalon Studio is the best free automation tool but needs community support. This has a similar feature like selenium ide of record and playback. When you record any actions e.g. Login; the system automatically identifies and captures object in the object repository. With little research, a user who does not have coding knowledge can automate basic flows of a web application. The best way to use it, first capture all objects present on all pages, rename as per your requirement and save in appropriate folders.

Sometimes a user may get stuck while running recorded script because of error in finding the object. For unknown errors, community support is required which is present but not on a bigger level like Selenium Webdriver.
